# In this lab, we will create a Pet class that will keep track of the type of animal, color, food, noise and name of a given animal.

# Create a class called Pet that has the following attributes:
# Animal (e.g., dog, cat, fish)
# Color (e.g., spotted, tabby, gold)
# Food (e.g., kibbles, tuna, fish flakes)
# Noise (e.g., meow, woof, splash)
# Name (e.g., Scooby Doo, Fluffy, Bubbles)

# Specifications
# Make sure to use the __init__ method to create these attributes.
# Create a list of pets.
# Create a function that takes in a list of pets and prints out the name and the food attributes.
# Test your function with your list of pets.
