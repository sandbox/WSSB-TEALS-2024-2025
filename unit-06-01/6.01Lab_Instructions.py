# Instructions

## Write a program that uses a dictionary to offer users the meanings of
## common Internet abbreviations.

## The program, dictionary_lab.py, prompts the user to enter an internet
## abbreviation they would like explained. If the requested abbreviation is in
## the program's dictionary (use the in keyword with an if statement to test this),
## then it prints out the definition. If the abbreviation is not in the dictionary,
## the program prints an apologetic message saying that it could not find a definition.

# Example Output

## >>> python3 dictionary_lab.py

## What word would you like to look up? nbd
## nbd: a phrase meaning no big deal

## What word would you like to look up? kittens
## Sorry, 'kittens' is not defined

## What would would you like to look up?

# Bonus

## Extend the program with any of these features:

## The user can:

### update the definitions (values) for existing abbreviations in the dictionary
### add new abbreviations (keys) and provide their definitions (values).
### delete entries (key, value pairs) from the dictionary.
### get the entire dictionary printed to the screen.

### Lesson 6.01 did not cover all the techniques for manipulating
### dictionaries that you will need to program these features. Search for
### the necessary information in the? and the?.
