# Finish writing the __add__ method for the time class from the Do Now.
#
# Write a definition for a class named Kangaroo with the following methods:
# An __init__ method that initializes an attribute named pouch_contents to an empty list.
# A method named put_in_pouch that takes an object of any type and adds it to pouch_contents.
# A __str__ method that returns a string representation of the Kangaroo object and the contents of the pouch.


# Extra Credit
# Return to your Pet class from Lab 7.02. Research the isinstance function to write a method, is_friend that will take in another pet and return True if the two pets are friends, and false if they are not.

# Rules
# If they are both dogs they are friends.
# If the instance is a dog and the other pet is a cat, they are friends.
# If the instance is a cat and the other is a dog they are not friends.
# If they are both cats they are not friends.
