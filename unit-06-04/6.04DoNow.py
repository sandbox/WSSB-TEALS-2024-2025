my_dictionary = {
    'a': 1,
    'b': 2,
    'c': 3,
    'd': 4,
    'e': 5
}
print(list(my_dictionary))

# In your Notebook, respond to the following

# 1. Write down what list() does when given a dictionary.
# 2. What type does list() return?
# 3. Write down how you might use a for loop to go through and 
# print the values of my_dictionary.

# Try implementing your solution to #3 above.
