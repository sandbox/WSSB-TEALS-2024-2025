# Run the following code:

def print_6_stars():
    my_string = ''
    for i in range(0, 6):
        my_string += ' *'
    print(my_string)        

# In your notebook, write down what the output of the 
# function print_6_stars is. 

# Write a function print_star_square that calls 
# print_6_stars in a loop to produce the following output.

#    * * * * * *
#    * * * * * *
#    * * * * * *
#    * * * * * *
#    * * * * * *
#    * * * * * *

# Rewrite the function print_star_square without using print_6_stars.
# Note that there are two ways (at least) to get the above output, 
# so just try doing both!
