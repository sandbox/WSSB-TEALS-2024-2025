# 4.03 Lab Instructions

# In this lab we will be drawing images using nested for loops.

# For each of the following problems, you will write a function 
# that will draw the desired output. You may use an extra function 
# if you find it helpful.

# Part 1
# Write a function, draw_7, to draw the 7×7 square (shown below)
#     * * * * * * *
#     * * * * * * *
#     * * * * * * *
#     * * * * * * *
#     * * * * * * *
#     * * * * * * *
#     * * * * * * *

# Part 2
# Write a function stars_and_stripes, that will draw a 3 sets of rows. 
# 1st a row of 7 stars followed by a row of 7 dashes (shown below)
#     * * * * * * *
#     - - - - - - -
#     * * * * * * *
#     - - - - - - -
#     * * * * * * *
#     - - - - - - -

# Part 3
# Write a function, increasing_triangle that will print out the following:
#     1
#     1 2
#     1 2 3
#     1 2 3 4
#     1 2 3 4 5
#     1 2 3 4 5 6
#     1 2 3 4 5 6 7

# Part 4
# Write a function, vertical_stars_and_stripes that will print out the following:
#     - * - * - * -
#     - * - * - * -
#     - * - * - * -
#     - * - * - * -
#     - * - * - * -
#     - * - * - * -
#     - * - * - * -

# Part 5: Bonus
# Use a function to create your own pattern or drawing. 
# Some possible pattern ideas:

# Write a function that will print a border around a 7×7 square (shown below)
#     * * * * * * * *
#     * - - - - - - *
#     * - - - - - - *
#     * - - - - - - *
#     * - - - - - - *
#     * - - - - - - *
#     * - - - - - - *
#     * - - - - - - *
#     * * * * * * * *

# Write a function that will print the following balanced_triangle.
#     1
#     1 2
#     1 2 3
#     1 2 3 4
#     1 2 3 4 5
#     1 2 3 4 5 6
#     1 2 3 4 5 6 7
#     1 2 3 4 5 6
#     1 2 3 4 5
#     1 2 3 4
#     1 2 3
#     1 2
#     1

# Write a function that will print the following triangle.
#        *
#       ***
#      *****
