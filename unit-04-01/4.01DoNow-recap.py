# Formal Definition Time
#
#   A loop is a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached.
#
#   Each repetition is called an iteration.
#
# What was the example we did yesterday using the for loop?
# What did using a for loop help us accomplish?
#   Remember how much code it took to add an 's' to each fruit in our
#   multi_fruit when we didn't have a for loop?
#
# Finish writing the for loop and adding to our multi_fruit list


# Another for loop example
#
# We can use the for loop to search through a list and find
# the item we're interested in
#
# Make a list of animals
# Find the animal in your list that starts with your favorite letter
# Print the animal you found
