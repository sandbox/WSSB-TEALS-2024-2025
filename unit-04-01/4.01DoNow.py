# 1. Run the following code

single_fruit = ['apple', 'banana', 'watermelon', 'grape']
multi_fruit = []
multi_fruit.append(single_fruit[0] + 's')
multi_fruit.append(single_fruit[1] + 's')
multi_fruit.append(single_fruit[2] + 's')
multi_fruit.append(single_fruit[3] + 's')
print(multi_fruit)

# In your notebook, respond to the following
# Briefly write down what happened. What would happen if you added 
# 100 items to the list single_fruit? Write down how you would update 
# multi_fruit.

# 2. Run the following code:

list_of_numbers = [3, 5, 10, 23]
for num in list_of_numbers:
    print("num is " + str(num))


# In your notebook, respond to the following
# Briefly write down what happened. How would this change if you added 100 items to list_of_numbers?

# 3. Rewrite the code from part 1 using knowledge from part 2.
