# Type and run the following code

# my_building is a representation of the apartments on
# each floor of my 3 story building

my_building = [
  ['apt1a', 'apt1b', 'apt1c'],
  ['apt2a', 'apt2b', 'apt2c'],
  ['apt3a', 'apt3b', 'apt3c']
]
print("first floor: " + str(my_building[0]))
print("first floor, 3rd apartment: " + str(my_building[0][2]))

# Write down what was printed.

# first floor: ['apt1a', 'apt1b', 'apt1c']
# first floor, 3rd apartment: apt1c

# How would you access the 2nd apartment of the 3rd floor (apt3b)?


## Part 2

# 1. Print all the apartments one at a time

# 2. How would you show all apartments in a single list?

# 3. Change all "c" apartments to say "suite"

# 4. Print all the apartments that don't end in 'a'

# 5. Add "(newly renovated!)" to all apartment names

# Bonus: Add a "d" apartment to each list using the same naming convention
